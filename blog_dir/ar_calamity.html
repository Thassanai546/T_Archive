              The Calamity Mod is a large content mod for Terraria which adds
              many hours of endgame content and dozens of enemies and bosses
              dispersed throughout the vanilla game's progression. The Calamity
              Mod also features several harder difficulty modes, five new biomes
              and new structures, a new class, more than fifty new songs, over
              fifty recipes for previously uncraftable vanilla items and other
              assorted changes to vanilla gameplay.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Forward</h2>
            <p>
              I completed the Terraria Calamity mod this weekend and I found it
              to be truly amazing. I have been playing Terraria for years and
              have too many hours in the PC and console version. I never got
              around to playing the Calamity mod however until recently. I am
              super glad that I did, as it would go on to be my best Terraria
              adventure yet. This mod was completely free for a game which I
              picked up for about 5 euro many years ago. If you have not played
              Terraria, I will always recommend it and now - with the Calamity
              mod using "tModLoader" (Available on Steam!).
            </p>
            <p>
              Terraria has four base "Classes" - Melee, Ranger, Mage, and
              Summoner with Calamity adding one new class, the Rogue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up, mage was always my favourite class in Terraria. As
              such I decided that my first run using this mod would be dedicated
              to the way of the Mana Star.

            <p>
              This piece is a high-level overview of the major points during my
              run.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Adventure</h2>
            <p>Let's rewind to the start.</p>
            <p>
              I decided that my playthrough would be "Expert" mode. This mode
              greatly increases the difficulty of the game. I decided to do this
              because it allows for the chance to obtain exclusive content
              during the run. These are an award to the player for taking on an
              increased challenge!
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is a list of only some of the exclusive "Expert" mode items.
              These would prove to be extremely useful throughout by journey.
              Note the Wall of Flesh drop: "Demon Heart" granting me an entirely
              new accessory slot.
            </p>
            <a href="#!"
              ><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/brd.PNG" alt="..."
            /></a>

            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Expert_Mode</span
            >

            <h2 class="section-heading">Early Game</h2>
            <p>
              I used the
              <a href="https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:Class_setups"
                >Calamity Class Setup Guide</a
              >
              during my run which was extremely useful to me. It gave me a good
              indication of where I should be at certain stages of my adventure.
              In the early game, our movement and damage are low. As such, this
              time is spent carefully preparing for the challenges ahead. Below
              is an image of some of the early game weapons (both vanilla and
              modded) that I was to try and aim for.
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/mage1.PNG" alt="..." />

            <p>
              After taking down the early game bosses such as Skeletron, I
              prepared for the Wall of Flesh using the equipment below. At this
              point in the game, I had the ability to explore the first layers
              of a new scary biome which was added with the mod: The Abyss. This
              biome reminded me a bit about the game: Subnautica - where you
              explore the depths of the ocean which is home to unspeakable
              terrors!
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/mage2.PNG" alt="..." />

            <br /><br />
            <h2>Hardmode</h2>
            <p>
              Moving on, I fought through the early ages of Hardmode and began
              seeking the items in the image below. This loadout was recommended
              for taking down Plantera:
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/mage3.PNG" alt="..." />

            <p>
              I had many new things available to me thanks to the Calamity mod,
              such as "Cryonic Ore", which spawned in the ice biome after
              defeating "Cryogen" (who was quite challenging!).
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are just some of the bosses taken on at this point of the
              game:
            </p>

            />
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/images/4/40/Aquatic_Scourge.png"

              Aquatic Scourage.</span
            >

            <p>
              Upon defeating Plantera, a new ore spawned: "Perennial Ore".
              Furthermore, enemies in the Dungeon have grown stronger and they
              now drop Ectoplasm, which is a crafting material I need to further
              the power of my Mage build. I was now at a point in the game in
              which I should be fighting: Golem, Leviathan and Anahita, and
              Astrum Aureus
            </p>

            <img

            />
            <span class="caption text-muted">[Astrum Aureus]</span>

            <h2>Post-Golem</h2>
            <p>
              After defeating Golem, another new Ore would spawn in my world.
              This was "Scoria" Ore. Moreover, "Plague" enemies have begun to
              spawn in the Jungle biome. At this point in the game, I could
              craft a material called "Life Alloy" which was used in many
              recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is an image of the equipment, and armour which I pursued at
              this point in the game. I went for the "Spectre" armour, and I
              swapped between the DPS mask, and the Healing mask of this armour
              set for maximum efficiency.
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/mage4.PNG" alt="..." />

            <p>
              Some of the bosses encountered at this point of the game present a
              great challenge!
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"

            >

            <p>
              A useful item I had at this point of the game was the "Sigil of
              Calamitas". When equipped, it increases magic damage by 15%,
              reduces mana usage by 10%, increases maximum mana by 100, and
              increases the pickup range for Mana Stars.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid"

              alt="..."
            />

            <br /><br />
            <h2>Moon Lord</h2>
            <p>
              When defeating the Lunatic Cultists, I had had access to the
              "Ancient Manipulator". This would allow me to craft gear using
              Lunar Fragments that would allow me to take on "Astrum Deus"
            </p>

            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/images/2/2e/Astrum_Deus.png"
              alt="..."
            />
            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >[Astrum Deus] Not to be confused with Astrum Aureus, that
              similarly-themed cyborg boss.</span
            >
            <p>
              At this point in the game I was able to obtain the "Ethereal
              Core", an item that would boost my maximum mana by 50.
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/moonlord_down.jpg" alt="..." />
            <span class="caption text-muted">Moon Lord down!</span>
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Post-Moon Lord</h2>
            <p>
              At this point it was time to begin preparing to take on a boss
              named "Providence". To do this I could prepare by using Luminite
              bars and Galactica Singularities. The Profaned Guardians could be
              fought at this point, which is required to get the Profaned Core
              to summon Providence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that Moon Lord was defeated, I had access to Luminite ore
              which I used to craft the "Nebula Armour". This is the final magic
              set available in vanilla Terraria.
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/nebula_armour.PNG" alt="..." />

              At this point in the journey Divine Geodes, Uelibloom Ore, and
              Bloodstone are available. Using these items, I could craft
              "Prismatic Armour", an armour set which the mod added that was
              more powerful than the previously mentioned Nebula Armour!

              The equipment shown in this image displays my loadout at this
              point in the game. I could not get the Thunderstorm which is a
              drop from the Storm Weaver boss. It is a 10% drop from that boss
              however, luck was against my side! I managed the prepare the other
              items however which was sufficient for me to progress.

              Before fighting Polterghast I had to take on "The Rune of Kos
              bosses". Each of these bosses drop a key crafting material needed
              to craft a "Cosmic Worm", which is used to summon: "The Devourer
              of Gods".

              each boss being summoned with the Rune of Kos, the player must be
              in the correct biome to summon a certain boss. These biomes are
              Space for the Storm Weaver, the Dungeon for the Ceaseless Void,
              and The Underworld for Signus, Envoy of the Devourer."</span

            <h2>The Devourer of Gods</h2>
            <p>
              The fight against The Devourer of Gods is lengthy and difficult
              with several phases and numerous varying attacks behaviors.

              Defeating him grants access to Cosmilite Bars, a crafting material
              necessary for crafting a variety of late-game equipment. The
              Pumpkin Moon, Frost Moon, and Solar Eclipse events will
              significantly increase in difficulty as well, allowing enemies to
              drop Nightmare Fuel, Endothermic Energy, and Darksun Fragments
              respectively, which are also essential late-game crafting
              materials.

            <h2>Yharon</h2>
            <p>
              Yharon, Dragon of Rebirth (also known as Yharon, Resplendent
              Phoenix when he is at 55% health) is a major boss, intended to be
              fought after The Devourer of Gods. It is highly recommended to be
              well-equipped and prepared before summoning him as he can be
              incredibly challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Yharon fight was an amazing one, with even better music. It
              really felt like I was challenging a super boss.

              Defeating Yharon grants access to Yharon Soul Fragments and causes
              Auric Ore to spawn in the world. This would grant be access to one
              of the highest tiers of equipment in the journey.

              Yharon has a 10% chance of dropping: "Yharim’s Crystal". It is an
              extremely powerful magic weapon that is similar to the Last Prism.
              It fires six red and orange beams that converge into one yellow
              beam as it charges. It inflicts the

              Because my playthrough was for the Mage class it was only right
              for me to pursue getting this item to drop. I got it on perhaps my
              third or fourth battle against Yharon.
