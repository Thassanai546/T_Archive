                        <p>For those who grew up immersed in the Star Wars universe, the TIE Interceptor holds a special place in our hearts. Its distinctive silhouette, evocative of Imperial might and technological prowess, is faithfully captured in LEGO form. From the sleek lines to the menacing twin laser cannons, every element of this iconic starfighter is meticulously recreated, reminding us of the awe-inspiring spectacle of the original films.</p>

Relive Star Wars: Return of the Jedi action as you recreate its distinctive wings, detailed cockpit and laser cannons. We've even improved on the original Imperial design to build a more authentic replica using new building techniques and elements!</blockquote>

                        <br><h2>The Remaster</h2>
                        <p>For 2024 we saw a remake of what was the first entry into the "UCS" line. Below is an image of this model.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://images.brickset.com/sets/large/7181-1.jpg?199910241113" alt="..." />
                        <p>Comparing these models is a clear way to see how far Lego has come since the year 2000. With new elements and building techniques available, I found that they were able to create one of the most impressive looking models to date. I was very impressed with how it looked and knew I had to get it.</p>

                        <h2>May the 4th (be with you)</h2>
                        <p>For May the 4th, people who purchased the new Interceptor were gifted a collectible coin for The Battle of Yavin. I really liked this gift with purchase, as the Battle of Yavin was one of my favorite Star Wars scenes. The Battle of Yavin was one of the first major victories for the Rebels, and was during this battle where the Rebels complete the fateful Trench Run.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, I felt like this would be nice to display beside the new model!</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>One aspect of the model I was a huge fan of was the interior. It was highly detailed and made clever usage of available Lego elements. Moreover, this Interceptor has got an X-Wing in its sights.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75382-1/75382_alt2.jpg" alt="..." />
                        
                        <br>
                        <p>Construction took several days, however it was a very enjoyable experience. The final model is huge and impressive. The information plaque that came with this model was also printed, which was a great touch. The figure it comes with is highly detailed, and he even comes with a little mouse droid. You can freely remove the model from its stand however, I don't necessarily recommend this. I really don't have any complaints about this particular model, and I highly recommend it if you have the shelf space.</p>
                        <p>I am very glad I picked this set up. I had been putting some savings aside for May the 4th 2024 and was happy to finally be part of the UCS club. During May the 4th event, Lego put several of their other UCS sets on sale, with one of those being the 75355 UCS X-Wing. I could not help but think to myself how cool both the TIE Interceptor and X-Wing would look next to each other.</p>
                        <p>I had been having trouble trying to decide between the Interceptor and X-Wing for a while. One thing led to another and I found myself with only one right option...</p>
