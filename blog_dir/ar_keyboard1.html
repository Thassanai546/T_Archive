                        <h3>Foreword</h3>
                        <p>After my Corsair K70 with Cherry MX Blues started having issues, I found myself in the market for a new keyboard. I'd seen countless custom builds online, particularly on communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a>, where people shared incredible designs that both looked and sounded amazing. Inspired by these creations, I decided that when it was time to search for a new keyboard, I would try my hand at building one myself.</p>
                        <p>After some exploring I decided that I would go for a GMMK build.</p>
                        <h3>Frame</h3>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0549/2681/files/GMMK_Pro_-_Exploded_-_Twitter_1200x675_-_r3.jpg?v=1604529773" alt="..." />
                        <p>The GMMK Pro is a 75% keyboard with 87 keys, which was perfect for me since it retains dedicated function keys and arrow keys. I was also drawn to its aluminum body with a sleek anodized finish. The chassis alone cost $200.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Switches</h3>
                        <p>With a name like Holy Panda, I had high hopes for these switches—and they didn’t disappoint. The snappy, tactile feel was excellent.</p>
                        <p>However, they came at a price. Sold in batches of 35 for $42 each, I ended up spending $126 on switches alone. Needless to say, my expectations for the final build were pretty high.</p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>Here they are in hand</p>
                        <br>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/NzvEXYr.jpeg"/>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>Result</h3>
                        <p>The hot-swap switches made assembling this board quick and easy. I also picked up a coiled cable and double shot PBT keycaps, which I highly recommend—they're durable and of great quality. By this point, I had spent around $300, but the build turned out fantastic. It’s an incredible keyboard both in feel and sound. For now, I can’t see myself spending this much on another keyboard anytime soon. My poor wallet! :(
